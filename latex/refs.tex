\section{Reviewer \#1}

\RC This paper explains a common practical issue: the cause of
clusterization in Bayesian D-optimal designs in infinite dimensions
and why adding a correlated measurement process decluster the design
points. Its theoretical results are valuable to the field of inverse
problems/uncertainty quantification and the conclusions should be
useful to practitioners in this field.


\AR I appreciate the kind words.



\RC However, I feel changing the assumption from independent to correlated
measurements is quite artificial: people tweak a data generation
process assumption to solve an optimal design problem, and the author
just takes the assumption as it is.

\AR If I understand correctly --- I completely agree. I added text
  emphasizing that I do not endorse using correlated errors:

    E &= mc^2 \\
    m\cdot \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a=F}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{v=p}\DIFaddend .
  \end{align}


We then calculate the fraction of clustered designs of the simulations
we ran, for each pair $m,k$. Clusterization occurred at high rates
($>99.9\%$) whenever $m-k > 1$; see Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_AAt}. Hence, in
these simulations, clusterization is a generic property. However, when
$m-k = 1$, clusterization does not occur. We do not why this is so and
further investigation into this phenomenon is out of scope for the
current study.

      generating $M$). It is evident that when $m-k \geq 2$ clusterization
      is ubiquitous, whereas for lower $m-k$ clusterization does not
      occur.}

\AR*But I actually have no idea what you were talking about.
