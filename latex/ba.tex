\begin{abstract}
  Estimation of parameters in physical processes often demands costly
  measurements, prompting the pursuit of an optimal measurement
  strategy. Finding such strategy is termed the problem of
  \emph{optimal experimental design}, abbreviated as optimal
  design. Remarkably, optimal designs can yield tightly clustered
  measurement locations, leading researchers to fundamentally revise
  the design problem just to circumvent this issue. Some authors
  introduce error correlation among error terms that are initially
  independent, while others restrict measurement locations to a finite
  set of locations. While both approaches may prevent clusterization,
  they also fundamentally alter the optimal design problem.

  In this study, we consider Bayesian D-optimal designs, i.e.~designs
  that maximize the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between
  posterior and prior. We propose an analytically tractable model for
  D-optimal designs over Hilbert spaces. In this framework, we make
  several key contributions: \textbf{(a)} We establish that
  measurement clusterization is a generic trait of D-optimal designs
  with independent Gaussian measurement errors, and prove that
  introducing correlations among measurement error terms mitigates
  clusterization. \textbf{(b)} We characterize D-optimal designs as
  reducing uncertainty across a subset of prior covariance
  eigenvectors. Finally, \textbf{(c)} We leverage this
  characterization to argue that measurement clusterization arises as
  a consequence of the pigeonhole principle: when more measurements
  are taken than there are locations where the select eigenvectors are
  large and others are small --- clusterization occurs.
