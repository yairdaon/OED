This study is a result of research I started during my PhD studies
under the instruction of Prof. Georg Stadler at the Courant Institute
of Mathematical Sciences. I would like to thank him for his great
mentorship, attention to details and kindness. I would also like to
thank Christian Remling, who helped me find a proof for Lemma
\ref{lemma:free} in
\href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/280168/redistribute-diagonal-entries-of-a-matrix/280203#280203c}{Mathoverflow}.
