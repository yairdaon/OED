\begin{abstract}
  We investigate the problem of sensor clusterization in D-optimal
  experimental design for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse
  problems. We suggest an analytically tractable model for D-optimal
  designs and reason how it may lead to sensor clusterization in the
  case of iid observation noise. We also consider how spatially
  correlated observation and model errors mitigate the clusterization
  phenomenon.

  %% As a part of the analysis we prove a Matrix Determinant
  %% Lemma in Hilbert spaces and a lemma for calculating
  %% $\frac{\der}{\der t} \log \det (I + X(t))$ for certain
  %% operator-valued functions. We also show how to decompose $M = AA^t$
  %% with $A$ constrained to have unit norm columns.
