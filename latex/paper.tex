\begin{abstract}
  We investigate the problem of sensor clusterization in D-optimal
  experimental design for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse
  problems. Many authors seem to believe that the fact that spatial
  correlations mitigateWe suggest an analytically tractable model for D-optimal
  designs. We argue that sensor clusterization in the case of iid
  observation noise is generic. We also prove that a model error term
  mitigates the clusterization phenomenon.

  %% As a part of the analysis we prove a Matrix Determinant
  %% Lemma in Hilbert spaces and a lemma for calculating
  %% $\frac{\der}{\der t} \log \det (I + X(t))$ for certain
  %% operator-valued functions. We also show how to decompose $M = AA^t$
  %% with $A$ constrained to have unit norm columns.
