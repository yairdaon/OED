\begin{abstract}
  Inversion for parameteres of physical processes typically requires
  taking expensive measurements. Finding an optimal set of
  measurements is known as the optimal design problem. Surprisingly,
  measurement locations in optimal design are sometimes extremely
  clustered. Practically and intuitively, measurement clusterization
  is a huge problem. Researchers usually avoid measurement
  clusterization by somehow modifying the optimal design problem. We
  consider a certain flavor of the optimal design problem, based on
  the Bayesian D-optimality criterion. We suggest an analytically
  tractable model for Bayesian D-optimal designs in linear inverse
  problems over Hilbert spaces. We prove that measurement
  clusterization poses no obstruction to D-optimality. We demonstrate
  that measurement clusterization is a generic property of D-optimal
  designs, and prove that measurement correlation mitigates the
  clusterization of measurements. We also give a full characterization
  of D-optimal designs, which shows that D-optimal designs uniformly
  reduce uncertainty in the space of observations. Most importantly,
  we show how measurement clusterization can be avoided without
  changing the optimal design problem.
