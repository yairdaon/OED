\begin{abstract}
  Inversion for parameteres of physical processes typically requires
  taking expensive measurements; finding an optimal set of
  measurements is known as the optimal design problem. Surprisingly,
  measurement locations in optimal designs are sometimes extremely
  clustered. Since measurement clusterization is nonintuitive,
  researchers often avoid it by modifying the optimal design
  problem. We consider a certain flavor of the optimal design problem,
  based on the Bayesian D-optimality criterion, and suggest an
  analytically tractable model for Bayesian D-optimal designs in
  linear inverse problems over Hilbert spaces. We prove that
  measurement clusterization poses no obstruction to D-optimality. We
  demonstrate that measurement clusterization is a generic property of
  D-optimal designs, and prove that correlated noise between
  measurements mitigates clusterization. We also give a full
  characterization of D-optimal designs, which shows that D-optimal
  designs uniformly reduce uncertainty in the space of
  observations. Finally, we show how measurement clusterization can be
  avoided without changing the optimal design problem.
