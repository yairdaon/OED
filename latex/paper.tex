  \textbf{Setup} Taking measurements for inversion for physical
  processes requires expesive measurements.  \textbf{Problem}
  Unfortunately, when optimizing measurement locations, measurements
  get clustered.  \textbf{Why care} This a imortatn \textbf{What
    others do} Many researchers tried to avoind measuremnt
  clusterization, typically by modifying the optimization problem
  \textbf{What we do} We consider an analytically tractable model for
  Bayesian D-optimal design over Hilbert spaces. We prove that
  measurement clusterization poses no obstruction to D-optimality. We
  demonstrate that measuremnt clusterization is a generic property of
  D-optimal designs, and prove that measurement correlation mitigates
  the problem of measurement clusterization. We also give a full
  characterization of D-optimal designs, which, surprisingly, shows
  that D-optimal desings reduce uncertainty in the space of
  observations.  \textbf{Test on data} We test our conclusions via
  numeric implementation of our model
