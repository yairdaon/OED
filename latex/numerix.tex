\section{Numerical Experiments}
We provide numerical evidence supporting our conclusions.


\subsection{Heat Equation}
Our goal is to infer the initial condition of
the one-dimensional heat equation with a homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:heat equation}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    u_t &= \Delta u &&\qquad \text{in } [0,1] \times [0,\infty),\\
      u &= 0 &&\qquad \text{on } \{0, 1\} \times [0,\infty),\\
        u &= u_0 &&\qquad \text{on }[0,1] \times \{0\}.
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

Model the prior for the initial condition as $u_0 \sim
\normal(0,\prcov)$, for $\prcov = (-\Delta)^{-1}$ with a homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary condition. Let the final time $T = 0.03$ and denote
$\fwd$ the forward operator, so that $u(\cdot, T) = \fwd u_0$. Let
$\obs$ a measurement operator, so that $u(\x_j,T) = (\obs u)_j,
j=1,\dots,m$, where $m$ is the number of allowed measurements. Assume
iid centered Gaussian observation error, so observations are given by
$u(\x_j,T) + \eps(\x_j)$ with $\eps(\x_j) \sim \normal(0, \sigma^2)$
iid, $\sigma = 0.05$. Measurement locations $\x_j,j=1,\dots,m$ are
chosen according to the D-optimality criterion
\cite{AlexanderianGloorGhattas14}.

Implementation of this inverse problem can be found in this 
\href{https://github.com/yairdaon/OED}{repository}, including an optimization
routine for finding D-optimal designs. Unfortunately, I was not able
to install PyOED \cite{attia2023pyoed}, nor was I able to utilize
hIPPYlib \cite{VillaPetraGhattas16, VillaPetraGhattas18,
  VillaPetraGhattas21}, hence the inverse problem is implemented from
scratch.


\subsection{Simulating Lemma ... }
In theorem 17 we explicitly construct a D-optimal design in a Hilbert
space where the base vectors diagonalize $\fwd \prcov\fwd^*$. We
explicitly implement the algorithm outlined in Lemma



\subsection{Correlated errors}
We simulate the 1D heat eq
