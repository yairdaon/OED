The three referees found merits and interest in your work, but also
pointed out several major issues to be addressed. Of particular
concern to me, the paper's exposition jumps too quickly into the
formulation / maths without giving a proper intuition and
context. This makes the paper less accessible to readers who aren't
already quite familiar with inverse problems (which are introduced
with very little preamble, and it's not even immediately explicit what
are the parameters being learned) and optimal experimental design. A
referee makes valid points as to whether clusterization of
measurements is a problem in general, when in fact in can be an
appealing feature in some settings, and another referee asks whether
D-optimal designs should be abandoned altogether. The exposition needs
to discuss these high-level issues, and introduce the related
literature and results appropriately, to give the work proper
context. Altogether, I think that your work has the potential to make
a good contribution to Bayesian analysis, but as it currently stands
significant work is needed.
