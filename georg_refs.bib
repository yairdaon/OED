  Abstract                 = {Even though the art of reservoir simulation has evolved through more than four decades, there is still a substantial research activity that aims toward faster, more robust, and more accurate reservoir simulators. Here we attempt to give the reader an introduction to the mathematics and the numerics behind reservoir simulation. We assume that the reader has a basic mathematical background at the undergraduate level and is acquainted with numerical methods, but no prior knowledge of the mathematics or physics that govern the reservoir flow process is needed. To give the reader an intuitive understanding of the equations that model filtration through porous media, we start with incompressible single-phase flow and move step-by-step to the black-oil model and compressible two-phase flow. For each case, we present a basic numerical scheme in detail, before we discuss a few alternative schemes that reflect trends in state-of-the-art reservoir simulation. Two and three-dimensional test cases are presented and discussed. Finally, for the most basic methods we include simple Matlab codes so that the reader can easily implement and become familiar with the basics of reservoir simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Level set techniques are numerical techniques for tracking the evolution of interfaces. They rely on two central embeddings; first, the embedding of the interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function, and second, the embedding (or extension) of the interface's velocity to this higher dimensional level set function. This paper applies Sethian's Fast Marching Method, which is a very fast technique for solving the eikonal and related equations, to the problem of building fast and appropriate extension velocities for the neighboring level sets. Our choice and construction of extension velocities serves several purposes. First, it provides a way of building velocities for neighboring level sets in the cases where the velocity is defined only on the front itself. Second, it provides a subgrid resolution not present in the standard level set approach. Third, it provides a way to update an interface according to a given velocity field prescribed on the front in such a way that the signed distance function is maintained, and the front is never re-initialized; this is valuable in many complex simulations. In this paper, we describe the details of such implementations, together with speed and convergence tests and applications to problems in visibility relevant to semi-conductor manufacturing and thin film physics.},

  Abstract                 = {Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods (DGFEM) offer certain advantages over standard continuous finite element methods when applied to the spatial discretisation of the acoustic wave equation. For instance, the mass matrix has a block diagonal structure which, used in conjunction with an explicit time stepping scheme, gives an extremely economical scheme for time domain simulation. This feature is ubiquitous and extends to other time-dependent wave problems such as Maxwell's equations. An important consideration in computational wave propagation is the dispersive and dissipative properties of the discretisation scheme in comparison with those of the original system. We investigate these properties for two popular DGFEM schemes: the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method applied to the second-order wave equation and a more general family of schemes applied to the corresponding first order system. We show how the analysis of the multi-dimensional case may be reduced to consideration of one-dimensional problems. We derive the dispersion error for various schemes and conjecture on the generalisation to higher order approximation in space},

  Abstract                 = {A goal-oriented analysis of linear, stochastic advection-diffusion models is presented which provides both a method for solution verification as well as a basis for improving results through adaptation of both the mesh and the way random variables are approximated. A class of models problems with random coefficients and source terms is cast in a variational setting. Specific quantities of interest are specified which are also random variables. A stochastic adjoint problem associated with the quantities of interest is formulated and a posteriori error estimates are derived. These are used to guide an adaptive algorithm which adjusts the sparse probabilistic grid so as to control the approximation error. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the methodology for a specific model problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Tests of randomness of directions in three-dimensional space or equivalently tests of uniform distribution of points on the unit sphere are treated. One test is against alternatives which concentrate probability density near an equator, and the other is against alternatives which concentrate probability density near opposite poles; in each case the poles are unspecified. The tests are based on the latent roots of the matrix of sums of squares and cross-products of the co-ordinates of the observed points on the unit sphere. Against equatorial alternatives the null hypothesis is rejected if the smallest root is less than the appropriate significance point, and against bimodal alternatives the null hypothesis is rejected if the largest root is greater than the appropriate significance point. Tables of significance points are given, based on Monte-Carlo studies and the asymptotic distributions which are derived. The two-dimensional problem is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Model reduction is often required in several applications, typically due to limited available time, computer memory or other restrictions. In problems that are related to partial differential equations, this often means that we are bound to use sparse meshes in the model for the forward problem. Conversely, if we are given more and more accurate measurements, we have to employ increasingly accurate forward problem solvers in order to exploit the information in the measurements. Optical diffusion tomography (ODT) is an example in which the typical required accuracy for the forward problem solver leads to computational times that may be unacceptable both in biomedical and industrial end applications. In this paper we review the approximation error theory and investigate the interplay between the mesh density and measurement accuracy in the case of optical diffusion tomography. We show that if the approximation errors are estimated and employed, it is possible to use mesh densities that would be unacceptable with a conventional measurement model.},

  Abstract                 = {Polythermal conditions are found on all scales, from small valley glaciers to ice sheets. Conventional temperature-based "cold-ice" methods do not, however, account for the latent heat stored as liquid water within temperate ice. Such schemes are not energy- conserving when temperate ice is present. Temperature and liquid water fraction are, however, functions of a single enthalpy variable: A small enthalpy change in cold ice is a change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change in temperate ice is a change in liquid water fraction. The unified enthalpy formulation described here models the mass and energy balance for the three-dimensional ice fluid, for a surface runoff layer, and for a subglacial hydrology layer all coupled together in a single energy-conserving framework. It is implemented in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Results for the Greenland ice sheet are compared with those from a cold-ice scheme. This paper is intended to be an accessible foundation for enthalpy formulations in glaciology.},

  Abstract                 = {Derivatives of almost arbitrary functions can be evaluated efficiently by automatic differentiation whenever the functions are given in the form of computer programs in a high-level programming language such as Fortran, C, or C++. Furthermore, in contrast to numerical differentiation where derivatives are approximated, automatic differentiation generates derivatives that are accurate up to machine precision. The so-called forward mode of automatic differentiation computes derivatives by carrying forward a gradient associated with each intermediate variable simultaneously with the evaluation of the function itself. It is shown how software tools implementing the technology of automatic differentiation can benefit from simple concepts of shared memory programming to parallelize the gradient operations. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments. They were performed with a code that was generated automatically by the Adifor system and augmented with OpenMP directives.},

  Abstract                 = {For functions given in the form of a computer program, automatic differentiation is an efficient technique to accurately evaluate the derivatives of that function. Starting from a given computer program, automatic differentiation generates another program for the evaluation of the original function and its derivatives in a fully mechanical way. While the efficiency of this black box approach is already high as compared to numerical differentiation based on divided differences, automatic differentiation can be applied even more efficiently by taking into account high-level knowledge about the given computer program. We show that, in the case where the function involves a Fourier transform, the degree of parallelism in the program generated by automatic differentiation can be increased leading to a rich set of automatic parallelization strategies that are not available when employing a black box automatic parallelization approach. Experiments of the new automatic parallelization approach are reported on a SunFire~6800 server using up to 20 processors.},

  Abstract                 = {Today's computers allow us to simulate large, complex physical problems. Many times the mathematical models describing such problems are based on a relatively small amount of available information such as experimental measurements. The question arises whether the computed data could be used as the basis for decision in critical engineering, economic, and medicine applications. The representative list of engineering accidents occurred in the past years and their reasons illustrate the question. The paper describes a general framework for verification and validation (V\&V) which deals with this question. The framework is then applied to an illustrative engineering problem, in which the basis for decision is a specific quantity of interest, namely the probability that the quantity does not exceed a given value. The V\&V framework is applied and explained in detail. The result of the analysis is the computation of the failure probability as well as a quantification of the confidence in the computation, depending on the amount of available experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {An overview of the software design and data abstraction decisions chosen for deal.II, a general purpose finite element library written in C++, is given. The library uses advanced object-oriented and data encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements. Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries. The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.},

  Abstract                 = {Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function space. In $hp$ adaptive finite element methods, one defines these discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh. Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements, or for discontinuous Galerkin methods. In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms used in the implementation of $hp$ methods for arbitrary elements, and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence, we list the information a description of a finite element has to provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an $hp$ context. We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions, and demonstrate that the $hp$-specific parts of the program do not dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.II finite element library.},

  Abstract                 = {The connection between Bayesian statistics and the technique of regularization for inverse problems has been given significant attention in recent years. For example, Bayes' law is frequently used as motivation for variational regularization methods of Tikhonov type. In this setting, the regularization function corresponds to the negative-log of the prior probability density; the fit-to-data function corresponds to the negative-log of the likelihood; and the regularized solution corresponds to the maximizer of the posterior density function, known as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of the unknown, which in our case is an image. Much of the work in this direction has focused on the development of techniques for efficient computation of MAP estimators (or regularized solutions). Less explored in the inverse problems community, and of interest to us in this paper, is the problem of sampling from the posterior density. To do this, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which has previously appeared in the Bayesian statistics literature, is straightforward to implement, and provides a means of both estimation and uncertainty quantification for the unknown. Additionally, we show how to use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to compute image samples in cases where direct methods are not feasible. And finally, the MCMC method provides samples of the noise and prior precision (inverse-variance) parameters, which makes regularization parameter selection unnecessary. We focus on linear models with independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise and define the prior using a Gaussian Markov random field. For our numerical experiments, we consider test cases from both image deconvolution and computed tomography, and our results show that the approach is effective and surprisingly computationally efficient, even in large-scale cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The parallelization of two multigrid methods that are robust for systems of linear equations arising from the discretization of certain singularly perturbed elliptic partial differential equations is presented. The multigrid method with {ILU} smoother and the Frequency Decomposition Method, based on a multiple coarse grid correction, were implemented on a {MIMD} computer with distributed shared memory using a ring configuration for the first and a hypercube configuration for the second method. The speedups were determined for various grid sizes and numbers of processors. An objective comparison of both methods against the multigrid method with highly parallelizable red-black Gau{\ss}-Seidel smoother is made for the anisotropic equation and shows the superiority of both methods over the standard approach. The speedup of the {ILU} smoother is modelled and the influence of computer architecture on the speedup is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the reconstruction of two-dimensional objects from laboratory-controlled data in microwave tomography. This inverse problem is commonly ill-posed and nonlinear, therefore we propose to solve it in a Bayesian estimation framework using an iterative scheme to solve the optimization problem. This approach allows us to introduce a priori knowledge about the object function to be reconstructed. The experimental data were obtained in a controlled environment at Institut Fresnel (Marseille, France). The considered targets are either metallic or dielectric homogeneous cylinders. In this paper, the authors have only considered the data corresponding to the transverse magnetic polarization case. For these targets, the presented results show the potentiality of the proposed regularization scheme and the interest of these experimental data for testing inverse algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is of singular importance in sparse linear algebra. In contrast to the uniform regularity of dense linear algebra, sparse operations encounter a broad spectrum of matrices ranging from the regular to the highly irregular. Harnessing the tremendous potential of throughput-oriented processors for sparse operations requires that we expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and impose sufficient regularity on execution paths and memory access patterns. We explore SpMV methods that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large percentages of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices, respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285. This is roughly 2.8 times the throughput previously achieved on Cell BE and more than 10 times that of a quad-core Intel Clovertown system.},

  Review                   = {This paper reviews the extensive literature on the numerical solution of saddle point problems. Large linear systems of algebraic equations arise in diverse applications in computational science and engineering such as computational fluid dynamics, constrained optimization, image reconstruction and linear elasticity, for example. These systems are indefinite and often possess poor spectral properties. Therefore, they represent a significant challenge to those developing numerical software. The paper also considers saddle point problems arising from stabilized mixed finite element discretizations of systems such as the Stokes equations in fluid dynamics. The paper describes and discusses many solution methods for solving linear systems written in saddle point form, with the emphasis being on iterative methods for large sparse problems. Segregated and coupled methods are described. The Schur complement method and the null space method are examples of segregated methods, which involve a reduction in the dimension of the system. Coupled methods include both direct methods based on triangular factorizations of the global matrix and iterative algorithms such as Krylov subspace methods. Despite the successful development of efficient methods for certain classes of problems, including mixed finite element formulations of elliptic PDEs and Stokes problems, many challenges remain. For example, efficient preconditioners are yet to be developed for large classes of linear systems arising from interior point methods in constrained optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a multilevel algorithm for the solution of a source identification problem in which the forward problem is an elliptic partial differential equation on the 2D unit box. The Hessian corresponds to a Tikhonov-regularized first-kind Fredholm equation. Our method uses an approximate Hessian operator for which, first, the spectral decomposition is known, and second, there exists a fast algorithm that can perform the spectral transform. Based on this decomposition we propose a conjugate gradients solver which we precondition with a multilevel subspace projection scheme. The coarse-level preconditioner is an exact solve and the finer-levels preconditioner is one step of the scaled Richardson iteration. As a model problem, we consider the 2D-Neumann Poisson problem with variable coefficients and partial observations. The approximate Hessian for this case is the Hessian related to a problem with constant coefficients and full observations. We can use a fast cosine transform to compute the spectral transforms. We examine the effect of using Galerkin or level-discretized Hessian operators and we provide results from numerical experiments that indicate the effectiveness of the method for full and partial observations.},

  Abstract                 = {{This review is devoted to some inverse problems arising in the context of linear elasticity, namely the identification of distributions of elastic moduli, model parameters or buried objects such as cracks. These inverse problems are considered mainly for three-dimensional elastic media under equilibrium or dynamical conditions, and also for thin elastic plates. The main goal is to overview some recent results, in an effort to bridge the gap between studies of a mathematical nature and problems defined from engineering practice. Accordingly, emphasis is given to formulations and solution techniques which are well suited to general-purpose numerical methods for solving elasticity problems on complex configurations, in particular the finite element method and the boundary element method. An underlying thread of the discussion is the fact that useful tools for the formulation, analysis and solution of inverse problems arising in linear elasticity, namely the reciprocity gap and the error in constitutive equation, stem from variational and virtual work principles, i.e., fundamental principles governing the mechanics of deformable solid continua. In addition, the virtual work principle is shown to be instrumental for establishing computationally efficient formulae for parameter or geometrical sensitivity, based on the adjoint solution method. Sensitivity formulae are presented for various situations, especially in connection with contact mechanics, cavity and crack shape perturbations, thus enriching the already extensive known repertoire of such results. Finally, the concept of topological derivative and its implementation for the identification of cavities or inclusions are expounded.}},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate whether the recent slow-down of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), West Antarctica, may lead to its complete stoppage in the near future, using a numerical model. Basal resistance to ice-stream motion is represented by a continuous till layer whose strength changes in response to basal melting and freezing. We implement a basal drainage system, which acts to hinder ice-stream stoppage through supply of extra water to those parts of the bed that are experiencing freezing. The ice module is a standard flowline model with parameterized key out-of-plane effects (Raymond, 1996). The most important result of our modeling effort is that we never obtained a slow-down that would not be followed by a complete stoppage within <100 years. WIS slow-down can be avoided in the model if large basal water-input rates are assumed, to satisfy basal freezing. In comparison, the tested perturbations in WIS width and mass balance had a relatively small effect on the tendency of the simulated ice stream to slow down. These results underscore the need for more quantitative constraints on the efficiency of sub-ice-stream water drainage. We conjecture that the present-day slow-down of WIS will evolve to shut-down in the next few decades, unless an addition of basal water prevents freeze-on-driven bed strengthening.},

  Abstract                 = {Iterative inversion methods have been unsuccessful at inverting seismic data obtained from complicated earth models (e.g. the Marmousi model), the primary difficulty being the presence of numerous local minima in the objective function. The presence of local minima at all scales in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum. We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, low-frequency version of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition by scale. Furthermore, the method greatly reduces the computational burden of the inversion that will be of importance for 3-D extensions to the method.},

  Abstract                 = {A new generation, parallel adaptive-mesh mantle convection code, Rhea, is described and benchmarked. Rhea targets large-scale mantle convection simulations on parallel computers, and thus has been developed with a strong focus on computational efficiency and parallel scalability of both mesh handling and numerical solvers. Rhea builds mantle convection solvers on a collection of parallel octree-based adaptive finite element libraries that support new distributed data structures and parallel algorithms for dynamic coarsening, refinement, rebalancing and repartitioning of the mesh. In this study we demonstrate scalability to 122 880 compute cores and verify correctness of the implementation. We present the numerical approximation and convergence properties using 3-D benchmark problems and other tests for variable-viscosity Stokes flow and thermal convection.},

  Review                   = {This paper is concerned with adaptive mesh refinement in two and three dimensions using quadtrees and octrees respectively. The software p4est, which is described in the paper, is designed for large-scale parallel processing and to be scalable. Rather than using a single tree a forest of trees is used so that a wide variety of geometries can be dealt with. The software implements the creation and manipulation of these structures. It is designed to interface with external software such as those for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Consequently the criteria for refinement are provided externally. Full details of how the quadtree and octree forests are labelled and manipulated are given. This includes refinement and coarsening of the structure, and the possibility of including the requirement that ratios of adjacent element sizes are not greater than 2. The distribution and redistribution of data over a possibly large number of processes is also dealt with in detail. Synthetic and practical geophysical examples of the use of the software are given, and these illustrate the scalability of the software.},

  Abstract                 = {The solution of many problems in science and engineering is based on computational kernels for the numerical treatment of partial differential equations (PDEs) or N-body problems. Traditional solution methods however reduce these to linear algebra or brute force algorithms on structured data sets. Larger and larger simulations require smarter algorithms to be tractable. Hierarchical tree algorithms represent such a class, both for PDEs and for N-body problems. However, their efficient parallelization is not straightforward. Some difficulties can be removed, if one can provide a fast dynamic load-balancing scheme to cope with the tree variations of the unstructured data sets. In this paper we propose a very cheap yet very efficient load-balancing scheme for tree algorithms based on space-filling curves. Furthermore we present the Parnass2 cluster, on which such parallel codes perform extremely well. The cluster consists of SMP PCs and a Myrinet network at Gigabit/s speed configured with full bisection bandwidth. It turns out that it does not only has the obvious price/performance advantage, but also an absolute performance, which is comparable to the latest commercial Cray T3E.},

  Abstract                 = {We present simulations and performance results of nuclear burning fronts in super- novae on the largest domain and at the finest spatial resolution studied to date. These simulations were performed on the Intel ASCI-Red machine at Sandia National Laboratories using FLASH, a code developed at the Center for Astrophysical Thermonuclear Flashes at the University of Chicago. FLASH is a modular, adaptive mesh, parallel simulation code capable of handling compressible, reactive fluid flows in astrophysical environments. FLASH is written primarily in Fortran 90, uses the Message-Passing Interface library for inter-processor communication and portability, and employs the PARAMESH package to manage a block-structured adaptive mesh that places blocks only where resolution is required and tracks rapidly changing flow features, such as detonation fronts, with ease. We describe the key algorithms and their implementation as well as the optimizations required to achieve sustained performance of 238 GFLOPS on 6420 processors of ASCI-Red in 64 bit arithmetic.},

  Abstract                 = {A unified a posteriori error analysis has been developed in [18, 21-23] to analyze the finite element error a posteriori under a universal roof. This paper contributes to the finite element meshes with hanging nodes which are required for local mesh-refining. The two-dimensional 1-irregular triangulations into triangles and parallelograms and their combinations are considered with conforming and nonconforming finite element methods named after or by Courant, $Q_1$, Crouzeix-Raviart, Han, Rannacher-Turek, and others for the Poisson, Stokes and Navier-Lame equations. The paper provides a unified a priori and a posteriori error analysis for triangulations with hanging nodes of degree $\leq 1$ which are fundamental for local mesh refinement in self-adaptive finite element discretisations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. We develop a new general purpose MCMC sampler for arbitrary con- tinuous distributions that requires no tuning. We call this MCMC the t-walk. The t-walk maintains two independent points in the sample space, and all moves are based on proposals that are then accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability on the product space. Hence the t-walk is provably con- vergent under the usual mild requirements. We restrict proposal distributions, or `moves', to those that produce an algorithm that is invariant to scale, and ap- proximately invariant to affine transformations of the state space. Hence scaling of proposals, and effectively also coordinate transformations, that might be used to increase efficiency of the sampler, are not needed since the t-walk's operation is identical on any scaled version of the target distribution. Four moves are given that result in an effective sampling algorithm. We use the simple device of updating only a random subset of coordinates at each step to allow application of the t-walk to high-dimensional problems. In a se- ries of test problems across dimensions we find that the t-walk is only a small factor less efficient than optimally tuned algorithms, but significantly outperforms gen- eral random-walk M-H samplers that are not tuned for specific problems. Further, the t-walk remains effective for target distributions for which no optimal affine transformation exists such as those where correlation structure is very different in differing regions of state space. Several examples are presented showing good mixing and convergence charac- teristics, varying in dimensions from 1 to 200 and with radically different scale and correlation structure, using exactly the same sampler. The t-walk is available for R, Python, MatLab and C++ at http://www.cimat.mx/~jac/twalk/.},

  Abstract                 = {Migration-based traveltime (MBTT) formulation provides algorithms for automatically determining background velocities from full-waveform surface seismic reflection data using local optimization methods. In particular, it addresses the difficulty of the nonconvexity of the least-squares data misfit function. The method consists of parameterizing the reflectivity in the time domain through a migration step and providing a multiscale representation for the smooth background velocity. We present an implementation of the MBTT approach for a 2-D finite-difference (FD) full-wave acoustic model. Numerical analysis on a 2-D synthetic example shows the ability of the method to find much more reliable estimates of both long and short wavelengths of the velocity than the classical least-squares approach, even when starting from very poor initial guesses. This enlargement of the domain of attraction for the global minima of the least-squares misfit has a price: each evaluation of the new objective function requires, besides the usual FD full-wave forward modeling, an additional full-wave prestack migration. Hence, the FD implementation of the MBTT approach presented in this paper is expected to provide a useful tool for the inversion of data sets of moderate size.},

Included in our discussion are uniqueness theorems, decomposition methods (including the point-source method), the method of singular sources, the linear sampling method and the factorization method.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the implementation of the nonlinear Galerkin method as a multiresolution method when a two-level Fourier-collocation discretization is used. The set of collocation points with an even number of points is considered as the fine grid and decomposed into two coarse grids containing half as many points. Using these two grids we decompose the unknown into the sum of a large scale component containing only low frequency modes and based on one of the coarse grids and a small scale component containing only high frequency modes and based on the other coarse grid. This produces interesting connections between the physical space and the Fourier space representations of the function. A nonlinear Galerkin scheme is then applied to the Burgers equation; finally, implementation issues are discussed showing the advantages of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of finite element computation depends strongly on the quality of the geometric mesh and the efficiency of the numerical solution of the linear systems resulting from the discretization of partial differential equation (PDE) models. It is common knowledge that mesh geometry affects not only the approximation error of the finite element solution but also the spectral properties of the corresponding stiffness matrix. In this paper, for typical second-orderelliptic problems, some refined relationships between the spectral condition number of the stiffness matrix and the mesh geometry are established for general finite element spaces defined on simplicial meshes. The derivation of such relations for general high-order elements is based on a new trace formula for the element stiffness matrix. It is shown that a few universal geometric quantities have the same dominant effect on the stiffness matrix conditioning for different finite element spaces. These results provide guidance to the studies of both linear algebraic solvers and the unstructured geometric meshing.},

The authors give an alternative formulation for the pressure convection-diffusion preconditioner and the least squares commutator preconditioner that favours commuting properties near the boundary. With certain choices of boundary conditions, the new preconditioners show improved performance for solving Navier-Stokes equations with fewer GMRES iterations for the model problems considered. In particular, mesh-independent convergence rates for GMRES are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider non-linear ill-posed problems in a Hilbert space setting. We show that Tikhonov regularisation is a stable method for solving non-linear ill-posed problems and give conditions that guarantee the convergence rate O( square root delta ) for the regularised solutions, where delta is a norm bound for the noise in the data. They illustrate these conditions for several examples including parameter estimation problems. In an appendix, they study the connection between the ill-posedness of a non-linear problem and its linearisation and show that this connection is rather weak. A sufficient condition for ill-posedness is given in the case that the non-linear operator is compact.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a nonlinear optimization method for large-scale 3D elastic full-waveform seismic inversion. The method combines outer Gauss-Newton nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations, globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of finer grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite elements in the Lam\'{e} parameter space to provide flexibility and avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner, the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the global minimum, and the ability to fit the observational data while reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing sharp interfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {A new scheme for differentiating complex mesh-based numerical models (e.g. finite element models), the Independent Set Perturbation Adjoint method (ISP-Adjoint), is presented. Differentiation of the matrices and source terms making up the discrete forward model is realized by a graph coloring approach (forming independent sets of variables) combined with a perturbation method to obtain gradients in numerical discretizations. This information is then convolved with the mathematical adjoint, which uses the transpose matrix of the discrete forward model. The adjoint code is simple to implement even with complex governing equations, discretization methods and non-linear parameterizations. Importantly, the adjoint code is independent of the implementation of the forward code. This greatly reduces the effort required to implement the adjoint model and maintain it as the forward model continues to be developed; as compared with more traditional approaches such as applying automatic differentiation tools. The approach can be readily extended to reduced-order models. The method is applied to a one-dimensional Burgerss equation problem, with a highly non-linear high-resolution discretization method, and to a two-dimensional, non-linear, reduced-order model of an idealized ocean gyre.},

This is the first attempt at introducing a moving computational domain into an adjoint model with mesh adaptivity. We also provide insight into the feasibility and reliability of the adaptive mesh adjoint model. The use of differing adapting meshes for forward and adjoint problems is considered here, where each mesh is optimized with respect to the individual properties of each solution. The free surface test case considered is that of flow in a two-dimensional vertical fluid slice. In this test case the sea surface elevation boundary conditions is optimized by assimilating sea surface height observations. The feasibility of an assimilation approach on adapting moving domains is demonstrated by comparison with a fixed mesh result.},

  Abstract                 = {The traditional approach to investigating the stability of a physical system is to linearise the equations about a steady base flow, and to examine the eigenvalues of the linearised operator. Over the past several decades, it has been recognised that this approach only determines the asymptotic stability of the system, and neglects the possibility of transient perturbation growth arising due to the nonnormality of the system. This observation motivated the development of a more powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which focusses instead on the singular value decomposition of the linearised propagator of the system. While GST has had sig- nificant successes in understanding the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its more widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing the SVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint: deriving the tangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable challenge, and manually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious. In this paper, we present a framework for the automation of generalised stability theory, which overcomes these difficulties. Given a compact high-level symbolic representa- tion of a finite element discretisation of the nonlinear equations, efficient C++ code is automatically generated to assemble the forward, tangent linear and adjoint models; these models are then used to calculate the optimally growing perturbations to the forward model, and their growth rates. By automating the stability computations, we hope to make these powerful tools a routine part of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of the framework is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid dynamics, phase separation, chemical reaction-diffusion, and quantum mechanics.},

  Abstract                 = {Concepts of turbulent flow control have become of growing importance during the last few years, following increased interest in the detailed structural scenario of turbulence??in particular our improved understanding of coherent structures on the one hand (the prerequisite), and a need for improvement of technological processes on the other (the goal). These considerations have mainly been followed by engineers and physicists concerned with problems in aerodynamics. It is our aim to draw the attention of a wider group of engineers to turbulent flow control in order to speed up the transfer of knowledge from aerodynamics to applications in other fields of engineering. In this paper an attempt is made to compile a major body of the available knowledge on flow control in separated and wall bounded turbulent flows. After a brief introduction of the basics of control theory (Section 2) and of the major flow structures and their stability characteristics (Section 3) free and wall bounded turbulent shear flows are discussed (Sections 4 and 5). This discussion summarizes the main relationships between structure and flow behaviour and shows possibilities of influencing properties of these flows such as increasing mixing or avoiding separation. },

Critical to this effort is the use of geometrically nonconforming elements that allow localized refinement in regions of interest, coupled with a stabilized high-order time-split formulation of the semi-discrete Navier-Stokes equations. Simulations of transition in a model of an arteriovenous graft illustrate the potential of this approach in biomechanical applications},

The ISMIP-HOM setup consists of five diagnostic and one prognostic experiments, for both 2-D and 3-D geometries. For all the tests, the full-Stokes equations are solved. Some technical points concerning FE, such as mesh characteristics, stabilisation methods, numerical methods used to solve the linear system and parallel performance are discussed. For all these setups, the CPU time consumption in relation to the accuracy of the solution is analysed. Based on these findings, some general rules on optimising the computing time versus the accuracy of the results are deduced.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a model reduction approach to the solution of large-scale statistical inverse problems in a Bayesian inference setting. A key to the model reduction is an efficient representation of the non-linear terms in the reduced model. To achieve this, we present a formulation that employs masked projection of the discrete equations; that is, we compute an approximation of the non-linear term using a select subset of interpolation points. Further, through this formulation we show similarities among the existing techniques of gappy proper orthogonal decomposition, missing point estimation, and empirical interpolation via coefficient-function approximation. The resulting model reduction methodology is applied to a highly non-linear combustion problem governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation (PDE). Our reduced model is used as a surrogate for a finite element discretization of the non-linear PDE within the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling employed by the Bayesian inference approach. In two spatial dimensions, we show that this approach yields accurate results while reducing the computational cost by several orders of magnitude. For the full three-dimensional problem, a forward solve using a reduced model that has high fidelity over the input parameter space is more than two million times faster than the full-order finite element model, making tractable the solution of the statistical inverse problem that would otherwise require many years of CPU time.

  Abstract                 = {The paper reviews the construction of hierarchical $H^1$-conforming shape functions for 1D (edge), 2D (triangle, quad) and 3D (hexahedron, tetrahedron, prism, pyramid) elements. The logic of implementation is based on identifying a set of core (kernel, bubble) 1D and 2D functions, and the use of specific edge-to-element and face-to-element extensions. The resulting implementation allows for an instantaneous modification (or redefinition) of core functions without any changes in the rest of the FE code. The 3D shape functions conform automatically to 1D edge and 2D face shape functions defined in local edge and face coordinates. In other words, the dependence of 3D shape functions on different edge and face orientations is taken into account at the level of element shape functions routine. This eliminates the use of sign factors during the assembly and simplifies dramatically the implementation of constrained approximation allowing for the presence of hanging nodes. The construction of shape functions is directly related to transfinite interpolation techniques used in mesh based geometry (MBG) descriptions.},

Its world-class authors provide guidance on all aspects of Bayesian data analysis and include examples of real statistical analyses, based on their own research, that demonstrate how to solve complicated problems. Changes in the new edition include: \&\#183;Stronger focus on MCMC\&\#183;Revision of the computational advice in Part III\&\#183;New chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysis\&\#183;Several additional applied examples from the authors' recent research\&\#183;Additional chapters on current models for Bayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and more\&\#183;Reorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collectionBayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation. The new approach, additional examples, and updated information make Bayesian Data Analysis an excellent introductory text and a reference that working scientists will use throughout their professional life.}},

Throughout the discussion we emphasize recent developments in the area such as spectral penalty methods, the use of filters, the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon, and issues related to the solution of nonlinear conservations laws such as conservation and convergence. We also include a brief discussion on the formulation of multi-domain methods for hyperbolic problems, and conclude with a few examples of the application of pseudospectral/collocation methods for solving nontrivial systems of conservation laws.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the stability of spectral approximations to scalar hyperbolic initial-boundary value problems with variable coefficients. Time is discretized by explicit multi-level or Runge-Kutta methods of order $\le 3$ (forward Euler time-differencing is included), and we study spatial discretizations by spectral and pseudospectral approximations associated with the general family of Jacobi polynomials. We prove that these fully explicit spectral approximations are stable provided their time step, $\Delta t$ , is restricted by the {CFL}-like condition $\Delta t < \operatorname{Const} \bullet {N^{ - 2}}$ , where $N$ equals the spatial number of degrees of freedom. We give two independent proofs of this result, depending on two different choices of appropriate $L^2$-weighted norms. In both approaches, the proofs hinge on a certain inverse inequality interesting for its own sake. Our result confirms the commonly held belief that the above {CFL} stability restriction, which is extensively used in practical implementations, guarantees the stability (and hence the convergence) of fully-explicit spectral approximations in the nonperiodic case.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we give a survey on the three main aspects of the efficient treatment of PDEs, i.e. adaptive discretization, multilevel solution and parallelization. We emphasize the abstract approach of subspace correction schemes and summarize its convergence theory. Then, we give the main features of each of the three distinct topics and treat the historical background and modern developments. Furthermore, we demonstrate how all three ingredients can be put together to give an adaptive and parallel multilevel approach for the solution of elliptic PDEs and especially of linear elasticity problems. We report on numerical experiments for the adaptive parallel multilevel solution of some test problems, namely the Poisson equation and Lam{\'e}'s equation. Here, we emphasize the parallel efficiency of the adaptive code even for simple test problems with little work to distribute, which is achieved through hash storage techniques and space-filling curves.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial differential equations can be solved efficiently by adaptive multigrid methods on a parallel computer. We report on the concept of hash-table storage techniques to set up such a program. The code requires substantial less amount of memory than implementations based on tree type data structures and is easier to program in the sequential case. The parallelization takes place by a space-filling curve domain decomposition intimately connected to the hash table. The new data structure simplifies the parallelization of the code substantially and introduces a cheap way to solve the load balancing and mapping problem. We report on the main features of the method and give the results of numerical experiments with the new parallel solver on a cluster of 64 Pentium II/400MHz connected by a Myrinet in a fat tree topology.},

  Review                   = {This paper focuses on iterative solutions of linear algebraic systems arising from the discretization and linearization of incompressible non-Newtonian fluid equations. Systems of this type also arise from the discretization of the Stokes problem with variable viscosity. An efficient preconditioner for the Schur complement matrix is developed. It relies on the mass matrix defined by a viscosity-weighted scalar product. Theoretical analysis of the corresponding continuous problem is made. Although it does not reveal full robustness with respect to the variation of the viscosity, numerical experiments show much better (almost robust) performance in comparison with standard mass-matrix based preconditioners. Finally, a combined Picard-Newton linearization in combination with the developed preconditioning is numerically tested.},

  Abstract                 = {An optimal estimation method for simultaneously determining both basal slipperiness and basal topography from variations in surface flow velocity and topography along a flow line on ice streams and ice sheets is presented. We use Bayesian inference to update prior statistical estimates for basal topography and slipperiness using surface measurements along a flow line. Our main focus here is on how errors and spacing of surface data affect estimates of basal quantities and on possibly aliasing/mixing between basal slipperiness and basal topography. We find that the effects of spatial variations in basal topography and basal slipperiness on surface data can be accurately separated from each other, and mixing in retrieval does not pose a serious problem. For realistic surface data errors and density, small-amplitude perturbations in basal slipperiness can only be resolved for wavelengths larger than about 50 times the mean ice thickness. Bedrock topography is well resolved down to horizontal scale equal to about one ice thickness. Estimates of basal slipperiness are not significantly improved by accurate prior estimates of basal topography. However, retrieval of basal slipperiness is found to be highly sensitive to unmodelled errors in basal topography.},

  Abstract                 = {We compare several different parallel implementation approaches for the clustering operations performed during adaptive meshing operations in patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) applications. Specifically, we target the clustering algorithm of Berger and Rigoutsos, which is commonly used in many SAMR applications. The baseline for comparison is a single program, multiple data extension of the original algorithm that works well for up to O(102) processors. Our goal is a clustering algorithm for machines of up to O(105) processors, such as the 64K-processor IBM BlueGene/L (BG/L) system. We first present an algorithm that avoids unneeded communications of the baseline approach, improving the clustering speed by up to an order of magnitude. We then present a new task-parallel implementation to further reduce communication wait time, adding another order of magnitude of improvement. The new algorithms exhibit more favorable scaling behavior for our test problems. Performance is evaluated on a number of large-scale parallel computer systems, including a 16K-processor BG/L system.},

  Abstract                 = {A proper choice of a proposal distribution for Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, for example for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, is well known to be a crucial factor for the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical computation.},

The computational cost and memory requirements of such problems increases linearly with the number of right hand sides. For many applications this is the main bottleneck of the computation. In this paper we show that problems with multiple right hand sides can be reformulated as stochastic optimization problems that are much cheaper to solve. We discuss the solution methodology and use the direct current resistivity as a model problem to show the eectiveness of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A globally conservative Galerkin/least-squares formulation which attains correct shock structure is developed for any choice of variables. Only the choice of entropy variables satisfies exactly the discrete Clausius-Duhem inequality without any dissipative mechanisms, whereas for the rest of the variables, artificial diffusion is required to guarantee entropy production. The limit of the formulation is well defined for entropy variables and the primitive variables (p, u, T), leading to conservative incompressible formulations. The approach is stable for any continuous interpolations, both for compressible and incompressible flows. A comparative study of different variables is performed, indicating that entropy variables and the primitive variables (p, u, T) possess the most attributes for practical problem solving.},

  Abstract                 = {The optical behaviour of a surface carrying a transition layer is discussed, as a problem in scattering. The results are given of the application of electromagnetic theory to the case of a single parallel-sided film. Methods are given for extending this treatment to the case of multiple parallel-sided layers. Both analytical and graphical solutions are considered. Features governing the design of certain multilayer systems are given. A survey is made of the many methods now available for the determination of the thickness and optical constants of materials in the form of thin films. The range, accuracy and conditions of application of the various methods are summarized. A selection of the results obtained on a range of metallic and dielectric films is made and the basis of interpretation of these results is given. It is shown that the apparently anomalous variations of the optical constants of metal films with film thickness can be attributed to the granular nature of such films. Although less spectacular variations are observed in the properties of dielectric films, it is seen that for some materials the optical behaviour suggests the presence of marked inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Films formed chemically and electrolytically are briefly mentioned. Recent methods of controlling the thickness of films during deposition are given, together with a selection of the more important applications of thin films in optics. These include anti-reflecting and high reflecting systems, narrow-band, wide-band and cut-on multilayer filters, the use of thin films in polarizing systems and the application of thin films in heat-absorbing systems.},

The PCM allows the uncertainty in transient behavior of power systems to be studied using only a handful of simulations. The relevant theory is outlined here and simple examples are used to illustrate the application of PCM in a power systems setting. In addition, an index for identification of key uncertain parameters, as well as an example with a more realistic power system, are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the ultra weak variational formulation for simulating time-harmonic Maxwell problems. This study has two main goals. First, we introduce a novel derivation of the UWVF method which shows that the UWVF is an unusual version of the standard upwind discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with a special choice of basis functions. Second, we discuss the practical implementation of an electromagnetic UWVF solver. In particular, we propose a method to avoid the conditioning problems that are known to hamper the use of the UWVF for problems in general geometries and inhomogeneous media. In addition, we show how to implement the PML in the UWVF to accurately approximate physically unbounded problems and discuss the parallelization of the UWVF. Three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to examine the feasibility of the UWVF for simulating wave propagation in inhomogeneous media and scattering from complex structures.},

  Abstract                 = {A computationally efficient means for propagation of uncertainty in computational models is provided by the stochastic response surface method (SRSM), which facilitates uncertainty analysis through the determination of statistically equivalent reduced models. SRSM expresses random outputs in terms of a {\tt{}"{}}polynomial chaos expansion{\tt{}"{}} of Hermite polynomials, and uses an efficient collocation scheme with regression to determine the coefficients of the expansion. This polynomial form then allows straightforward determination of statistics such as the mean and variance, and of first and second order sensitivity information. Further improvements in computational efficiency are achieved by coupling SRSM with automated source code differentiation tools, which produce code for partial derivatives with respect to model inputs and parameters. One such combination is the SRSM-ADIFOR, a combination of SRSM with the automatic differentiation of FORTRAN (ADIFOR). ADIFOR provides estimates of partial derivatives from a single model run, and this partial derivative information is used in the determination of the coefficients of the polynomial chaos expansions. Furthermore, SRSM can be used in conjunction with Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to reduce uncertainties by incorporating observational information in estimates of model parameters. An overview of the application of SRSM, SRSM-ADIFOR, and the combined SRSM and MCMC methods to complex mechanistic models describing environmental systems is presented here, and the advantages over traditional techniques are discussed.},

We employ and generalize the enhancement techniques based on BV- and Perona-Malik-type regularization methods. The problem is cast as the minimization of a cost functional consisting of a data fitting and a restoration energy criterion for multiscale objects consisting of edge, flat and grey regions. An iterative algorithm for finding the restored object that minimizes the cost functional is developed and analysed. It is based upon a fixed-point iteration combining a time-marching and successive substitution method for finding a solution to a quasi-elliptic partial differential equation. Global convergence is proved. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Although climate models have steadily improved their ability to reproduce the observed climate, over the years there has been little change to the wide range of sensitivities exhibited by different models to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Stochastic optimization is used to mimic how six independent climate model development efforts might use the same atmospheric general circulation model, set of observational constraints, and model skill criteria to choose different settings for parameters thought to be important sources of uncertainty related to clouds and convection. Each optimized model improved its skill with respect to observations selected as targets of model development. Of particular note were the improvements seen in reproducing observed extreme rainfall rates over the Tropical pacific which was not specifically targeted during the optimization process. As compared to the default model sensitivity of 2.4{^\circ}C, the ensemble of optimized model configurations had larger and narrow range of sensitivities around 3{^\circ}C, but with different regional responses related to the uncertain choice in optimized parameter settings. These results suggest current generation models, if similarly optimized, may become more convergent in their measure of global sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. However this exploration of the possible sources of modeling and observational uncertainty is not exhaustive. The optimization process illustrates an objective means for selecting an ensemble of plausible climate model configurations that quantify a portion of the uncertainty in the climate model development process.},

This method stems from the theory of inertial manifolds and approximate inertial manifolds which has proved to be a powerful tool of investigation for dynamical systems. The authors briefly review some results concerning the attractors for the Navier-Stokes equations and their approximations. Then the authors authors discuss the implementation of the nonlinear Galerkin method in the case of spectral methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we discuss an application of a fictitious domain method to the numerical simulation of the mechanical process induced by press-fitting cementless femoral implants in total hip replacement surgeries. Here, the primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its advantages over competing numerical methods for a wide range of applications for which the primary input originates from computed tomography-, magnetic resonance imaging- or other regular-grid medical imaging data. For this class of problems, the fictitious domain method is a natural choice, because it avoids the segmentation, surface reconstruction and meshing phases required by unstructured geometry-conforming simulation methods. We consider the implantation of a press-fit femoral artificial prosthesis as a prototype problem for sketching the application path of the methodology. Of concern is the assessment of the robustness and speed of the methodology, for both factors are critical if one were to consider patient-specific modelling. To this end, we report numerical results that exhibit optimal convergence rates and thus shed a favourable light on the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Using an inverse mantle convection model that assimilates seismic structure and plate motions, we reconstruct Farallon plate subduction back to 100 million years ago. Models consistent with stratigraphy constrain the depth dependence of mantle viscosity and buoyancy, requiring that the Farallon slab was flat lying in the Late Cretaceous, consistent with geological reconstructions. The simulation predicts that an extensive zone of shallow-dipping subduction extended beyond the flat-lying slab farther east and north by up to 1000 kilometers. The limited region of flat subduction is consistent with the notion that subduction of an oceanic plateau caused the slab to flatten. The results imply that seismic images of the current mantle provide more constraints on past tectonic events than previously recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {We apply concentration-of-measure inequalities to the quantification of uncertainties in the performance of engineering systems. Specifically, we envision uncertainty quantification in the context of certification, i.e., as a tool for deciding whether a system is likely to perform safely and reliably within design specifications. We show that concentration-of-measure inequalities rigorously bound probabilities of failure and thus supply conservative certification criteria. In addition, they supply unambiguous quantitative definitions of terms such as margins, epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, verification and validation measures, confidence factors, and others, as well as providing clear procedures for computing these quantities by means of concerted simulation and experimental campaigns. We also investigate numerically the tightness of concentration-of-measure inequalities with the aid of an imploding ring example. Our numerical tests establish the robustness and viability of concentration-of-measure inequalities as a basis for certification in that particular example of application.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increase in the computing power and the advent of supercomputers, the approximation of evolution equations on large intervals of time is emerging as a new type of numerical problem. The authors consider the approximation of evolution equations on large intervals of time when the space discretization is accomplished by finite elements. The algorithm that they propose, called the nonlinear Galerkin method, stems from the theory of dynamical systems and amounts to some approximation of the attractor in the discrete (finite elements) space. The utilization of incremental unknown is accomplished in finite elements by using hierarchical bases. Besides a detailed description of the algorithm, the article includes some technical results on finite elements spaces, and a full study of the stability and convergence of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {Glaciers and ice sheets play a dynamic role in Earth's climate system, influencing regional- and global-scale climate and responding to climate change on time scales from years to millennia. They are also an integral part of Earth's landscape in alpine and polar regions, where they are an active agent in isostatic, tectonic, and Earth surface processes. This review paper summarizes recent progress in understanding and modelling ice sheet dynamics, from the microphysical processes of ice deformation in glaciers to continental-scale processes that influence ice dynamics. Based on recent insights and research directions, it can be expected that a new generation of ice sheet models will soon replace the current standard. Improvements that can be foreseen in the near future include: (i) the addition of internally-consistent evolutionary equations for ice crystal fabric (anisotropic flow laws), (ii) more generalized flow laws that include different deformation mechanisms under different stress regimes, (iii) explicit incorporation of the effects of chemical impurities and grain size (dynamic recrystallization) on ice deformation, (iv) higher-order stress solutions to the momentum balance (Stokes' equation) that governs ice sheet flow, and (v) the continued merger of ice sheet models with increasingly complex Earth systems models, which include fully-coupled subglacial hydrological and geological processes. Examples from the Greenland Ice Sheet and Vatnajokull Ice Cap, Iceland are used to illustrate several of these new directions and their importance to glacier dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a reformulation of the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, that seeks to accelerate Bayesian inference by using polynomial chaos (PC) expansions to represent random variables. Evaluation of integrals over the unknown parameter space is recast, more efficiently, as Monte Carlo sampling of the random variables underlying the PC expansion. We evaluate the utility of this technique on a transient diffusion problem arising in contaminant source inversion. The accuracy of posterior estimates is examined with respect to the order of the PC representation, the choice of PC basis, and the decomposition of the support of the prior. The computational cost of the new scheme shows significant gains over direct sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {The treatment of multioffset seismic data as an acoustic wave field is becoming increasingly disturbing to many geophysicists who see a multitude of wave phenomena, such as amplitude-offset variations and shearwave events, which can only be explained by using the more correct elastic wave equation. Not only are such phenomena ignored by acoustic theory, but they are also treated as undesirable noise when they should be used to provide extra information, such as $S$-wave velocity, about the subsurface. The problems of using the conventional acoustic wave equation approach can be eliminated via an elastic approach. In this paper, equations have been derived to perform an inversion for $P$-wave velocity, $S$-wave velocity, and density as well as the $P$-wave impedance, $S$-wave impedance, and density. These are better resolved than the Lam\'{e} parameters. The inversion is based on nonlinear least squares and proceeds by iteratively updating the earth parameters until a good fit is achieved between the observed data and the modeled data corresponding to these earth parameters. The iterations are based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The fundamental requirement of such a least-squares algorithm is the gradient direction which tells how to update the model parameters. The gradient direction can be derived directly from the wave equation and it may be computed by several wave propagations. Although in principle any scheme could be chosen to perform the wave propagations, the elastic finite-difference method is used because it directly simulates the elastic wave equation and can handle complex, and thus realistic, distributions of elastic parameters. This method of inversion is costly since it is similar to an iterative prestack shot-profile migration. However, it has greater power than any migration since it solves for the $P$-wave velocity, $S$-wave velocity, and density and can handle very general situations including transmission problems. Three main weaknesses of this technique are that it requires fairly accurate a priori knowledge of the low-wavenumber velocity model, it assumes Gaussian model statistics, and it is very computer-intensive. All these problems seem surmountable. The low-wavenumber information can be obtained either by a prior tomographic step, by the conventional normal-moveout method, by a priori knowledge and empirical relationships, or by adding an additional inversion step for low wavenumbers to each iteration. The Gaussian statistics can be altered by preconditioning the gradient direction, perhaps to make the solution blocky in appearance like well logs, or by using large model variances in the inversion to reduce the effect of the Gaussian model constraints. Moreover, with some improvements to the algorithm and more parallel computers, it is hoped the technique will soon become routinely feasible.},

  Abstract                 = {The Colorado Plateau contains Late Cretaceous marine strata that are at a mean elevation of ~2 km. The timing and amount of uplift since the Cretaceous has generated considerable debate. With the exception of a few studies, topography supported by vertical stresses generated by viscous flow in the mantle has not been explicitly considered to contribute to the elevation of this region. Herein we compute the viscous flow beneath North America that is driven by density anomalies inferred from joint seismic-geodynamic modeling. We find that the Colorado Plateau overlies a strong mantle upwelling that is coupled to the sinking Farallon slab, currently beneath the eastern United States. Consequently, the Colorado Plateau is currently a focused dynamic topography high within the western U.S. Cordillera. Moreover, this strong upwelling impacts the base of the lithosphere at an oblique angle east of the plateau directly below the Rio Grande Rift. We attribute this flow as being responsible for some of the recent magmatic activity along the Jemez lineament as well as contributing to the recent rifting process in the Rio Grande Rift valley.},

  Abstract                 = {An adjoint-based functional optimization technique in conjunction with the spectral stochastic finite element method is proposed for the solution of an inverse heat conduction problem in the presence of uncertainties in material data, process conditions and measurement noise. The ill-posed stochastic inverse problem is restated as a conditionally well-posed $L_2$ optimization problem. The gradient of the objective function is obtained in a distributional sense by defining an appropriate stochastic adjoint field. The $L_2$ optimization problem is solved using a conjugate-gradient approach. Accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach is appraised with the solution of several stochastic inverse heat conduction problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This work proposes and analyzes an anisotropic sparse grid stochastic collocation method for solving partial differential equations with random coefficients and forcing terms (input data of the model). The method consists of a Galerkin approximation in the space variables and a collocation, in probability space, on sparse tensor product grids utilizing either Clenshawâ€“Curtis or Gaussian knots. Even in the presence of nonlinearities, the collocation approach leads to the solution of uncoupled deterministic problems, just as in the Monte Carlo method. This work includes a priori and a posteriori procedures to adapt the anisotropy of the sparse grids to each given problem. These procedures seem to be very effective for the problems under study. The proposed method combines the advantages of isotropic sparse collocation with those of anisotropic full tensor product collocation: the first approach is effective for problems depending on random variables which weigh approximately equally in the solution, while the benefits of the latter approach become apparent when solving highly anisotropic problems depending on a relatively small number of random variables, as in the case where input random variables are Karhunenâ€“Lo\`{e}ve truncations of \glqq smooth\grqq \ random fields. This work also provides a rigorous convergence analysis of the fully discrete problem and demonstrates (sub)exponential convergence in the asymptotic regime and algebraic convergence in the preasymptotic regime, with respect to the total number of collocation points. It also shows that the anisotropic approximation breaks the \textit{curse of dimensionality} for a wide set of problems. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results and are used to compare this approach with several others, including the standard Monte Carlo. In particular, for moderately large-dimensional problems, the sparse grid approach with a properly chosen anisotropy seems to be very efficient and superior to all examined methods.},

The abstract analysis is applied to a generalized Stokes problem, which yields robustness of the Cahouet-Chabard preconditioner. Motivated by models for two-phase incompressible flows we consider a generalized Stokes interface problem. Application of the general theory results in a new Schur complement preconditioner for this class of problems. The robustness of this preconditioner with respect to several parameters is treated. Results of numerical experiments are given that illustrate robustness properties of the preconditioner.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a stationary Stokes problem with a piecewise constant viscosity coefficient. For the variational formulation of this problem we prove a well-posedness result in which the constants are uniform with respect to the jump in the viscosity coefficient. We apply a standard discretization with a pair of LBB stable finite element spaces. The main result of the paper is an infsup result for the discrete problem that is uniform with respect to the jump in the viscosity coefficient. From this we derive a robust estimate for the discretization error. We prove that the mass matrix with respect to some suitable scalar product yields a robust preconditioner for the Schur complement. Results of numerical experiments are presented that illustrate this robustness property.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple nonrecursive form of the tensor decomposition in d dimensions is presented. It does not inherently suffer from the curse of dimensionality, it has asymptotically the same number of parameters as the canonical decomposition, but it is stable and its computation is based on lowrank approximation of auxiliary unfolding matrices. The new form gives a clear and convenient way to implement all basic operations efficiently. A fast rounding procedure is presented, as well as basic linear algebra operations. Examples showing the benefits of the decomposition are given, and the efficiency is demonstrated by the computation of the smallest eigenvalue of a 19-dimensional operator.},

A variety of coordinate-free algorithms from linear algebra and optimization, including Krylov subspace methods and various relatives of Newton's method for nonlinear equations and constrained and unconstrained optimization, may be expressed purely in terms of this system of classes. The resulting code may be used \textit{without alteration} in a wide range of control, design, and parameter estimation applications, in serial and parallel computing environments.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of the first ice sheet model intercomparison project for higher-order and full-Stokes ice sheet models. These models are compared and verified in a series of six experiments of which one has an analytical solution obtained from a perturbation analysis. The experiments are applied to both 2-D and 3-D geometries; five experiments are steady-state diagnostic, and one has a time-dependent prognostic solution. All participating models give results that are in close agreement. A clear distinction can be made between higher-order models and those that solve the full system of equations. The full-Stokes models show a much smaller spread, hence are in better agreement with one another and with the analytical solution.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an inter-comparison of three different models applied to various glacier geometries. The three models are built on different approximations of the Stokes equations, from the well known Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) to the full- 5 Stokes (FS) solution with an intermediate higher-order (HO) model which incorporates longitudinal stresses. The studied glaciers are synthetic geometries, but two of them are constructed so as to mimic a valley glacier and a volcano glacier. For each class of glacier, the bedrock slope and/or the aspect ratio are varied. First, the models are compared in a diagnostic way for a fixed and given geometry. Here the SIA surface ve10 locity can overestimate the FS velocity by a factor of 5 to a factor of 10. Then, the free surface is allowed to evolve and the time-dependent evolution of the glacier is studied. As a result, the difference between the models decreases, but can still be as large as a factor of 1.5 to 2. This decrease can be explained by a negative feedback for the SIA which overestimates velocities.},

The error estimator assesses the discretization error with respect to a given quantity of physical interest and separates the influence of the time and space discretizations. This allows us to set up an efficient adaptive strategy producing economical (locally) refined meshes for each time step and an adapted time discretization. The space and time discretization errors are equilibrated, leading to an efficient method.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an application of the newly developed CAFFE model (Continuum-mechanical, Anisotropic Flow model based on an anisotropic Flow Enhancement factor) to the EPICA ice core at Kohnen Station, DronningMaud Land, Antarctica (referred to as the EDML core). A one-dimensional flow model for the site is devised, which includes the anisotropic flow law and the fabric evolution equation of the CAFFE model. Three different solution methods are employed: (i) computing the ice flow based on the flow law of the CAFFE model and the measured fabrics; (ii) solving the CAFFE fabric evolution equation under the simplifying assumption of transverse isotropy; and (iii) solving the unrestricted CAFFE fabric evolution equation. Method (i) demonstrates clearly the importance of the anisotropic fabric in the ice column for the flow velocity. The anisotropic enhancement factor produced with method (ii) agrees reasonably well with that of method (i), even though the measured fabric shows a girdle structure (which breaks the transverse isotropy) in large parts of the ice core. For method (iii), we find that the measured fabric is reproduced well by the model down to ?2100m depth. Systematic deviations at greater depths are attributed to the disregard of migration recrystallization in the model.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel compression algorithm for 2D scientific data and images based on exponentially-convergent adaptive higher-order finite element methods (FEM). So far, FEM has been used mainly for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE), but we show that it can be applied to data and image compression easily. The adaptive compression algorithm is trivial compared to adaptive FEM algorithms for PDE since the error estimation step is not present. The method attains extremely high compression rates and is able to compress a data set or an image with any prescribed error tolerance. Compressed data and images are stored in the standard FEM format, which makes it possible to analyze them using standard PDE visualization software. Numerical examples are shown. The method is presented in such a way that it can be understood by readers who may not be experts of the finite element method.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we propose new parallel algorithms for the construction and 2:1 balance refinement of large linear octrees on distributed memory machines. Such octrees are used in many problems in computational science and engineering, e.g., object representation, image analysis, unstructured meshing, finite elements, adaptive mesh refinement, and N-body simulations. Fixed-size scalability and isogranular analysis of the algorithms using an MPI-based parallel implementation was performed on a variety of input data and demonstrated good scalability for different processor counts (1 to 1024 processors) on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's TCS-1 AlphaServer. The results are consistent for different data distributions. Octrees with over a billion octants were constructed and balanced in less than a minute on 1024 processors. Like other existing algorithms for constructing and balancing octrees, our algorithms have $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ work and $\mathcal{O}(N)$ storage complexity. Under reasonable assumptions on the distribution of octants and the work per octant, the parallel time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{n_p}\log(\frac{N}{n_p})+n_p\log n_p)$, where N is the size of the final linear octree and $n_p$ is the number of processors.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential semblance optimization (DSO) is an approach to inversion of reflection seismograms which avoids the severe convergence difficulties associated with nonlinear least-squares inversion. The method exploits both moveout and amplitude characteristics of reflections. We have implemented a version appropriate to plane-wave ($p$-tau) seismograms and layered constant-density acoustic earth models. Theoretical and numerical analyses of this version of DSO indicate that stable and reasonably accurate estimates of both velocity trend and reflectivity can be derived. To test DSO further, we applied it to a marine data set from the Gulf of Mexico, where the method produced results which compare favorably to well-log information. The method can be extended to incorporate laterally heterogeneous velocity models.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustics problems are governed by the linearized Euler equations. According to wave propagation theory, the number of wave nodes and their wave propagation characteristics are all encoded in the dispersion relations of the governing equations. Thus one is assured that the numerical solutions of a high order finite difference scheme will have the same number of wave modes (namely, the acoustic vorticity and entropy waves), the same wave propagation characteristics (namely, nondispersive, nondissipative, and isotropic) and the same wave speeds as those of the solutions of the Euler equations if both systems of equations have the same dispersion relations. Finite difference schemes which have the same dispersion relations as the original partial differential equations are referred to as dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) schemes. A way to construct time marching DRP schemes by optimizing the finite difference approximations of the space and time derivatives in the wave number and frequency space is proposed. The stability of these schemes is analyzed as a sufficient condition for numerical stability is established. A set of radiation and outflow boundary conditions compatible with the DRP schemes is constructed.},

It is first noted that, in addition to surface waves, the fields excited by realistic sources along thin films also include leaky waves. These fields can be described by inhomogeneous plane waves that bounce between the film boundaries and radiate energy into the exterior open regions. Leaky wave fields on multilayered and periodic media are examined and their role in beam and waveguide couplers is discussed. Finally, the construction of structures having variable leakage is described and their capabilities in providing a wide range of beam transformations are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of interpretation of seismic reflection data can be posed with sufficient generality using the concepts of inverse theory. In its roughest formulation, the inverse problem consists of obtaining the Earth model for which the predicted data best fit the observed data. If an adequate forward model is used, this best model will give the best images of the Earthâ€™s interior. Three parameters are needed for describing a perfectly elastic, isotropic, Earth: the density $\rho(x)$ and the Lam\'{e} parameters $\lambda(x)$ and $\mu(x)$, or the density $\rho(x)$ and the $P$-wave and $S$-wave velocities $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$. The choice of parameters is not neutral, in the sense that although theoretically equivalent, if they are not adequately chosen the numerical algorithms in the inversion can be inefficient. In the long (spatial) wavelengths of the model, adequate parameters are the $P$-wave and $S$-wave velocities, while in the short (spatial) wavelengths, $P$-wave impedance, $S$-wave impedance, and density are adequate. The problem of inversion of waveforms is highly nonlinear for the long wavelengths of the velocities, while it is reasonably linear for the short wavelengths of the impedances and density. Furthermore, this parameterization defines a highly hierarchical problem: the long wavelengths of the $P$-wave velocity and short wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance are much more important parameters than their counterparts for $S$-waves (in terms of interpreting observed amplitudes), and the latter are much more important than the density. This suggests solving the general inverse problem (which must involve all the parameters) by first optimizing for the $P$-wave velocity and impedance, then optimizing for the $S$-wave velocity and impedance, and finally optimizing for density. The first part of the problem of obtaining the long wavelengths of the $P$-wave velocity and the short wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance is similar to the problem solved by present industrial practice (for accurate data interpretation through velocity analysis and \glqq prestack migration\grqq). In fact, the method proposed here produces (as a byproduct) a generalization to the elastic case of the equations of \glqq prestack acoustic migration.\grqq Once an adequate model of the long wavelengths of the $P$-wave velocity and of the short wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance has been obtained, the data residuals should essentially contain information on $S$-waves (essentially $P-S$ and $S-P$ converted waves). Once the corresponding model of $S$-wave velocity (long wavelengths) and $S$-wave impedance (short wavelengths) has been obtained, and if the remaining residuals still contain information, an optimization for density should be performed (the short wavelengths of impedances do not give independent information on density and velocity independently). Because the problem is nonlinear, the whole process should be iterated to convergence; however, the information from each parameter should be independent enough for an interesting first solution.},

  Abstract                 = {The \textit{nonlinear} inverse problem for seismic reflection data is solved in the acoustic approximation. The method is based on the generalized leastâ€squares criterion, and it can handle errors in the data set and a priori information on the model. Multiply reflected energy is naturally taken into account, as well as refracted energy or surface waves. The inverse problem can be solved using an iterative algorithm which gives, at each iteration, updated values of bulk modulus, density, and time source function. Each step of the iterative algorithm essentially consists of a forward propagation of the actual sources in the current model and a forward propagation (backward in time) of the data residuals. The correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained yields the corrections of the bulk modulus and density models. This shows, in particular, that the general solution of the inverse problem can be attained by methods strongly related to the methods of migration of unstacked data, and commercially competitive with them.},

The two components of this simple differential system are intended to represent the large and small scale components of a flow. We show that many new numerical schemes can be introduced by treating differently the small and large scale components; also different time steps can be used for these two components. The stability analysis which we conduct for this simple model shows that these new multilevel schemes can produce a substantial saving in computing time, although the stability analysis leads sometime to counterintuitive conclusions. The error analysis for this model will be conducted elsewhere.},

Similarly the study of the approximation of the attractor in connection with the newly introduced concept of approximate inertial manifolds has produced a new approach to large eddy simulations and the study of the interaction of small and large eddies in turbulent flows. The author's aim is to survey and describe some of the new results concerning the functional properties of the Navier-Stokes equations and to discuss their relevance to turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an efficient and provably good partitioning and load balancing algorithm for parallel adaptive N-body simulation. The main ingredient of our method is a novel geometric characterization of a class of communication graphs that can be used to support hierarchical N-body methods such as the fast multipole method (FMM) and the Barnes--Hut method (BH). We show that communication graphs of these methods have a good partition that can be found efficiently sequentially and in parallel. In particular, we show that an N-body communication graph (either for BH or for FMM) can be partitioned into two subgraphs with equal computation load by removing only $O(\sqrt{n\log n})$ and $O(n^{2/3} (\log n)^{1/3})$ number of nodes, respectively, for two and three dimensions. These bounds on node-partition imply bounds on edge-partition of $O(\sqrt{n}(\log n)^{3/2})$ and $O(n^{2/3} (\log n)^{4/3})$, respectively, for two and three dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result on the quality of partitioning N-body communication graphs for nonuniformly distributed particles. Our results imply that parallel adaptive N-body simulation can be made as scalable as computation on regular grids and as efficient as parallel N-body simulation on uniformly distributed particles.},

  Abstract                 = {Representation of till rheology in glaciological models of ice motion over deformable sediments has, until now, focused largely on two end-member cases: (1) linear, or mildly non-linear, viscous rheology and (2) (nearly) plastic rheology. Most laboratory and in situ experiments support the latter model. Hindmarsh (1997) and Fowler (2002, 2003) proposed that experimental results represent the behavior of small till samples (characteristic length scales of \~{}0.1 to \~{}1 m) but that till behaves viscously over length scales that are relevant to determination of ice-flow rates in glaciers and ice sheets (\~{}1 km or more). Observations of short speed-up events on the ice plain of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, provide an opportunity to compare the in situ rheology of this till, integrated over \~{}10-100 km, with the rheology of till from beneath the same ice stream determined on small laboratory samples and in local borehole experiments. This comparison indicates that the rheology of the subglacial till beneath Whillans Ice Stream is independent of scale.},

  Abstract                 = {An inverse scattering method to reconstruct simultaneously the permittivity profile and the conductivity profile of one-dimensional inhomogeneons medium which makes use of the transverse electric (TE) wave and/or transverse magnetic (TM) wave, is proposed. The medium is illuminated by the TE and/or TM plane wave at oblique incidence, and the data are taken as the reflection coefficients for a set of discrete frequencies and/or a finite number of incident angles. Furthermore, the reflection coefficient data contain the Gaussian noise. The nonlinear integral equation relating the unknown constitutive parameter of the medium to the reflection coefficient for TE wave and/or TM wave is solved by the Newton iteration method. The inverse operator in the Newton method is determined by the regularization method. It is demonstrated in terms of the numerical examples that this method utilizing both polarizations and the incident angle of the incident plane wave is very effective even if the reflection coefficient contains the practical measurement error, or the phase of the reflection coefficient is unknown. Moreover, the relationships between the errors of reconstructed profile and the measured reflection coefficient are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic inverse problems in heat conduction with consideration of uncertainties in the measured temperature data, temperature sensor locations and thermophysical properties are addressed using a Bayesian statistical inference method. Both parameter estimation and thermal history reconstruction problems, including boundary heat flux and heat source reconstruction, are studied. Probabilistic specification of the unknown variables is deduced from temperature measurements. Hierarchical Bayesian models are adopted to relax the prior assumptions on the unknowns. The use of a hierarchical Bayesian method for automatic selection of the regularization parameter in the function estimation inverse problem is discussed. In addition, the method explores the length scales in the estimation of thermal variables varying in space and time. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is conducted to explore the high dimensional posterior state space. The methodologies presented are general and applicable to a number of data-driven engineering inverse problems. },

  Abstract                 = {{This work focuses on the identification of heterogeneous linear elastic moduli in the context of frequency-domain, coupled acoustic-structure interaction (ASI), using either solid displacement or fluid pressure measurement data. The approach postulates the inverse problem as an optimization problem where the solution is obtained by minimizing a modified error in constitutive equation (MECE) functional. The latter measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that connect kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible stresses, while incorporating the measurement data as additional quadratic error terms. We demonstrate two strategies for selecting the MECE weighting coefficient to produce regularized solutions to the ill-posed identification problem: 1) the discrepancy principle of Morozov, and 2) an error-balance approach that selects the weight parameter as the minimizer of another functional involving the ECE and the data misfit. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can successfully recover elastic parameters in 2D and 3D ASI systems from response measurements taken in either the solid or fluid subdomains. Furthermore, both regularization strategies are shown to produce accurate reconstructions when the measurement data is polluted with noise. The discrepancy principle is shown to produce nearly optimal solutions, while the error-balance approach, although not optimal, remains effective and does not need a priori information on the noise level.}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview and a detailed description of the key logic steps and mathematical-physics framework behind the development of practical algorithms for seismic exploration derived from the inverse scattering series. There are both significant symmetries and critical subtle differences between the forward scattering series construction and the inverse scattering series processing of seismic events. These similarities and differences help explain the efficiency and effectiveness of different inversion objectives. The inverse series performs all of the tasks associated with inversion using the entire wavefield recorded on the measurement surface as input. However, certain terms in the series act as though only one specific task, and no other task, existed. When isolated, these terms constitute a task-specific subseries. We present both the rationale for seeking and methods of identifying uncoupled task-specific subseries that accomplish: (1) free-surface multiple removal; (2) internal multiple attenuation; (3) imaging primaries at depth; and (4) inverting for earth material properties. A combination of forward series analogues and physical intuition is employed to locate those subseries. We show that the sum of the four task-specific subseries does not correspond to the original inverse series since terms with coupled tasks are never considered or computed. Isolated tasks are accomplished sequentially and, after each is achieved, the problem is restarted as though that isolated task had never existed. This strategy avoids choosing portions of the series, at any stage, that correspond to a combination of tasks, i.e., no terms corresponding to coupled tasks are ever computed. This inversion in stages provides a tremendous practical advantage. The achievement of a task is a form of useful information exploited in the redefined and restarted problem; and the latter represents a critically important step in the logic and overall strategy. The individual subseries are analysed and their strengths, limitations and prerequisites exemplified with analytic, numerical and field data examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We compare several different parallel implementation approaches for the clustering operations performed during adaptive meshing operations in patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) applications. Specifically, we target the clustering algorithm of Berger and Rigoutsos, which is commonly used in many SAMR applications. The baseline for comparison is a single program, multiple data extension of the original algorithm that works well for up to O(102) processors. Our goal is a clustering algorithm for machines of up to O(105) processors, such as the 64K-processor IBM BlueGene/L (BG/L) system. We first present an algorithm that avoids unneeded communications of the baseline approach, improving the clustering speed by up to an order of magnitude. We then present a new task-parallel implementation to further reduce communication wait time, adding another order of magnitude of improvement. The new algorithms exhibit more favorable scaling behavior for our test problems. Performance is evaluated on a number of large-scale parallel computer systems, including a 16K-processor BG/L system.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper multigrid smoothers of Vanka-type are studied in the context of Computational SolidMechanics (CSM). These smoothers were originally developed to solve saddle-point systems arising in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), particularly for incompressible flow problems. When treating (nearly) incompressible solids, similar equation systems arise so that it is reasonable to adopt the â€˜Vanka ideaâ€™ for CSM. While there exist numerous studies about Vanka smoothers in the CFD literature, only few publications describe applications to solid mechanical problems. With this paper we want to contribute to close this gap. We depict and compare four different Vanka-like smoothers, two of them are oriented towards the stabilised equal-order $Q_1/Q_1$ finite element pair. By means of different test configurations we assess how far the smoothers are able to handle the numerical difficulties that arise for nearly incompressible material and anisotropic meshes. On the one hand, we show that the efficiency of \textit{all} Vanka-smoothers heavily depends on the proper parameter choice. On the other hand, we demonstrate that only \textit{some} of them are able to robustly deal with more critical situations. Furthermore, we illustrate how the enclosure of the multigrid scheme by an outer Krylov space method influences the overall solver performance, and we extend all our examinations to the nonlinear finite deformation case.},

  Abstract                 = {An effective hp-adaptive finite-element (FE) approach is presented for a reliable and accurate solution of 3D electromagnetic scattering problems. The far field is approximated with the infinite-element method. This allows one to reduce the external domain (discretised with finite elements) to a minimum preserving the possibility of arbitrary reduction of the error as the method does not introduce modelling error. The work is focused on scattering from cavity backed apertures recessed in a ground plane. Near optimal discretisations that can effectively resolve local rapid variations in the scattered field can be obtained adaptively by local mesh refinements (so called h-type refinements) blended with graded polynomial enrichments (p-enrichments). The discretisation error can be controlled by a self-adaptive process, which is driven by a posteriori error estimates in terms of the energy norm or in a quantity of interest. The radar cross section (RCS) is an example of the latter. h- and p-adaptively constructed solutions are compared to pure uniform p approximations. Numerical, highly accurate, and fairly converged solutions for generic cavities are given and compared to previously published results.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, an a posteriori error estimation technique for hyperbolic conservation laws is proposed. The error distributions are obtained by solving a system of equations for the errors which are derived from the linearized hyperbolic conservation laws. The error source term is estimated using the modified equation analysis. Numerical tests for one-dimensional linear and non-linear scalar equations and systems of equations are presented. The results demonstrate that the error estimation technique can correctly predict the location and magnitude of the errors. In addition, it is shown in an example that the estimated error source terms can be used for grid adaptation to control the magnitude of error.},
